with some of \ref tcl_rules "surfit gridding rules" you can create special
gridding algorithms for solving 2d hydrodynamics tasks.

\par Description
Energy state of a productive oil formation is an important indicator used for 
the correct and effective planning of its further development. <B><TT>freeflow</TT></B>
implements the way of pressure fields reconstruction based on the 
constructing and consecutive minimization of functional sequence. In other
words <B><TT>freeflow</TT></B> extends \ref surfit "gridding algorithm" with new
\ref tcl_rules "gridding rules". It allows to reconstruct pressure fields 
from different data of different extent of thruth.

\par Two main ways of pressure fields reconstruction

There are two widely-used ways of solving pressure reconstruction problem:
\li Interpolation of the so-called "formation pressures", pressures measured 
in wells after two or three days of shut-down.

\li Creation of the mathematical model describing fluid filtration using 
the language of partial differential equations.

Due to the simplicity of usage, the first way is much more widely used PU 
(performance unit): there is no necessity in model tuning and algorithms 
are simply to use. Obtained pressure field is often physically inadequate, 
nevertheless it is used to analyze energy state of oil formation, to detect 
boundaries of reduced and raised pressure zones and calculate weighted 
average pressures within areas.

The second way is usually used in research institutes and model creation 
is well-expensive. Usually it takes about one year. The significant 
constraint involuntarily set up to mathematical models described by the 
terms of partial differential equations is connected with the correctness 
of a boundary problem. For example, to describe a well in mathematical model 
we set only fluid rate/injectivity or bottom hole pressure. The simultaneous 
setting of rates and pressures may lead to incorrect (overdetermined) boundary 
problem. However, the simultaneous setting of inconsistent data is frequent 
for solving of underground fluid filtration problems - there is a lot of 
inconsistent data with different levels of errors. 
Existent mathematical models require precise data with no errors (rates, 
pressures, permeability), but it is impossible in the real life. 
That's why the ability of mathematical model to take into account inconsistent 
data and data with errors is of high-interest for <B><TT>freeflow</TT></B>
<A HREF="mailto:surfit@bluebottle.com">authors</A>.

<B><TT>freeflow</TT></B> implements the method, which has the features of the 
both considered ways and has the ability to take into account often inconsistent 
values of rates and bottom hole pressures in wells.

\par Classical statement of the problem in the differential form.

We are considering the task of calculating an pressure field for a homogeneous 
productive oil formation with a relatively small thickness \f$ h \f$. In this case 
the function \f$ u(x,y) \f$ of the formation pressure can be considered two-dimensional.
\f$ u(x,y) \f$ is obtained by solving the boundary problem:
\f[
\frac {k}{\mu} \Delta u =
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} Q_i \delta(P-P_i) + \sum\limits_{j=1}^M \int\limits_l S_j(l)\delta(P-l)dl,
\f]
where \f$ k \f$ is permeability (\f$ m^2 \f$), \f$ \mu \f$ - liquid viscosity 
(\f$ Pa \cdot sec \f$). The vertical wells are described as point sources with 
volume flow rates of \f$ Q_i \quad ( m^3 / sec\f$). The position of horizontal 
(directional) wells and formation fractures are described by a curve with 
the curved source density of \f$ S_i \quad (m^2 / sec)\f$.

The boundary conditions are:
\li \f$ u|_\Gamma = u_0\f$ - value of pressure on the boundary (oil bearing outer contour);
\li \f$ u(P_k) = u_k, \quad k=1,\ldots,K \f$ - downhole pressures;
\li \f$ \nabla u \cdot n_l = 0|_l, \quad f = 1,\ldots,F \f$ - condition of non-filtration 
on the curves (boundaries of non-productive formations, tectonic zones).

For a differential equation of elliptical type the simultaneous setting of rates and 
pressures for the same points and/or curves of the area is incorrect but it is 
frequent when the formation energy state is studied. In order to use the overdetermined 
conditions and avoid the incorrectness the boundary problem is re-formulated as 
a variational problem.

\par Variational statement of the problem.

The pressure field is determined as cells of equidistant grid with values:
\f[
u(x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \sum\limits_{j=1}^M u_{i,j} \phi_{i,j}(x,y),
\f]
where \f$ \phi_{i,j}(x,y) = \phi_i(x) \phi_j(y) \f$,
\f[
 \phi_i \left( x \right) = \left\{
  1,x \in \left[ih + a - \frac{h}
{2},(i + 1)h + a - \frac{h}
{2}\right) 
\qquad 
0, x \notin \left[ih + a - \frac{h}
{2},(i + 1)h + a - \frac{h}
{2}\right) \hfill 
\right.
\f]

For each cell we use the flowing hypothesis:
\li cell pressure is a constant value
\li liquid viscosity and liquid density are constant for cell
\li liquid filtration processes because of different pressure in neighbour cells. 
Filtration processes in perpendicular direction to borders. For each border constant
permeability coefficient is set.

Following linear Darcy law, evalute filtration speeds throuth the cell borders:

\f[
\overline{\nu}_{i,j}^1 = - \frac{ k^1_{i,j} } { \mu_{i,j} } \frac{(u_{i+1,j}-u_{i,j})} {h_x} \overline{x},
\f]
\f[
\overline{\nu}_{i,j}^2 = - \frac{ k^2_{i,j} } { \mu_{i,j} } \frac{(u_{i,j+1}-u_{i,j})} {h_y} \overline{y},
\f]
\f[
\overline{\nu}_{i,j}^3 = - \frac{ k^1_{i-1,j} } { \mu_{i,j} } \frac{(u_{i,j}-u_{i-1,j})} {h_x} \overline{x},
\f]
\f[
\overline{\nu}_{i,j}^4 = - \frac{ k^2_{i,j-1} } { \mu_{i,j} } \frac{(u_{i,j}-u_{i,j-1})} {h_y} \overline{y},
\f]
where \f$ k_{i,j}^p \f$ cell permeability in \f$ \overline{\nu}_{i,j}^p \f$ direction, 
\f$ \mu_{i,j} \f$ liquid viscosity for (i,j) cell, \f$ \overline{x} \f$ unit vector in X direction,
\f$ \overline{y} \f$ unit vector in Y direction.

Consider two functionals:
\li Pressure in the cell:	
\f[
P_{i,j} = \sum\limits_{p=1}^P \alpha_p \left( u_{i,j} - u_p \right)^2 = \min,
\f]
where \f$ \alpha_p \geq 0 \f$ is an informational weight, determines the level of 
truth for the well pressure.
This functional describes the way of taking into account pressures of the wells, 
which belong to the (i,j) cell. Differentiation of this functional by \f$ u_{i,j} \f$
leads to the equation: 
\f[
u_{i,j} = \frac 
{ \sum\limits_{p=1}^P \alpha_p u_p }
{ \sum\limits_{p=1}^P \alpha_p }.
\f]

\li Cell rate: 
we use well-known variational principle describing filtration in porous 
medium: among all possible isothermal laminar flows of homogeneous incompressible liquid 
in cell with heterogeneous borders with filtration speed set, the real filtration flow 
is that the pressure forces work spent for filtration resistance is minimal.
For work of pressure forces in the cell we can write:
\f[
A_{i,j} = \frac{1}{2} \overline{F}_{i,j} \cdot \overline{\nu}_{i,j} - Q_{i,j} u_{i,j} = \min,
\f]
\f[
\overline{F}_{i,j} = \left( u_{i+1,j} - u_{i,j} \right)h_y h_z \overline{x} +
\left( u_{i,j+1} - u_{i,j} \right) h_x h_z \overline{y} +
\left( u_{i,j} - u_{i-1,j} \right)h_y h_z \overline{x} +
\left( u_{i,j} - u_{i,j-1} \right) h_x h_z \overline{y}
\f]
\f[
\overline{\nu}_{i,j} = \overline{\nu}_{i,j}^1 + \overline{\nu}_{i,j}^2 + \overline{\nu}_{i,j}^3 \overline{\nu}_{i,j}^4
\f]
Differentiation of this expression by \f$ u_{i,j} \f$ leads to law of conservation of mass 
written for the cell (i,j). <B><TT>freeflow</TT></B> implements the law of conservation of mass
in the simplest statement : \ref lcm_simple. To represent impermeable lines it is necessary to set zero 
filtration speed via suitable cell borders. It is effective to use \ref fault gridding rule for that. 

For each cell we consider three possible situations:

\li We know exact pressure for the cell. 
\f[
\begin{cases}
P_{i,j}=\min, \\
A_{i,j}=\min.
\end{cases}
\f]
The functional describing pressure is the first to be minimized, the functional describing rate is the second.

\li We know exact cell rate and permeable cell borders.
\f[
\begin{cases}
A_{i,j}=\min, \\
P_{i,j}=\min.
\end{cases}
\f]
he functional describing rate is the first to be  minimized, the functional describing pressure is the second.

\li We know cell debit with permeable cell borders and pressure for the cell. 
When we minimize combination of functionals:

\f[
\beta A_{i,j} + P_{i,j} = \min,
\f] 
where \f$ \beta \f$ determines degree of reliability for each of the functionals.

In case if we use only 1 and 2 types of functionals to obtain the solution, 
the solution will be the same as for corresponding boundary problem because 
we use only consistent data. In case of redundant and inconsistent data we 
use the third functional.

\par Example 1:

\image html freeflow_ex1.gif 

On the pictures you can see the results of the proposed algorithm. 
On the contour showed by a dashed line pressure of 250 atmospheres was set. 
On the first picture at the center the well with pressure of 200 
atmospheres was set. For the second picture in the center rate in 97 m3 per 
a second was assumed. The third picture is the result of calculation when 
both pressure and debit were assumed in the center. As you can see this 
result is approximately in the middle of results, showed in the first and 
second pictures. It means that we can take into account both of data - 
pressures and debits that is impossible to get by solving of a boundary 
problem. This result was obtained from scripts:
\li <A HREF="points_8tcl-example.html">points.tcl</A>
\li <A HREF="flow__points_8tcl-example.html">flow_points.tcl</A>
\li <A HREF="flow__points2_8tcl-example.html">flow_points2.tcl</A>

\par Example 2:

\image html freeflow_ex2.gif 

The second example is about determination of formation fracture for 
Arigol oilfield direction. Two situations were considered: horizontal 
and vertical formation fracture direction. For this fracture we know 
the rate and pressure and  take them into account writing the 
combination of two functionals. The result is that the best direction is 
vertical, because in this case each of the two functionals takes lower 
values, than for horizontal direction. This criterion is explained by 
the idea, that the correct fracture direction makes pressure and rate 
more consistent.
