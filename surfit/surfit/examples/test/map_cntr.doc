/** \example map_cntr.tcl   

This example shows how to build surface, which interpolates 3d contours. 
It was 3 contours to interpolate: one contour in center (cntr_center.txt),
and two circle contours (cntr_small_circle.txt and cntr_big_circle.txt).

Here is image of resulting surface:

Some comments to script:
\li \ref map_name variable used to set name of resulting surface
\li \ref grid_unload function call to remove grid from result file.
