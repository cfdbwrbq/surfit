/*! \page str String Expression Syntax

Starting from version 2.2 surfit supports Tcl string matching functionality. You can use
this feature for specifying set of data objects, gridding rules and etc. It works like 
pattern for filenames. For example, if you want to see names of all surfaces in memory you
should use command

\ref surf_getName "surf_getName" "*"

or 

\ref surf_getName "surf_getName" "my_*"

for all surfaces with name starting with "my_".
