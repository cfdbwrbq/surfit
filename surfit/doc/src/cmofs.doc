/*! \page surfit Description of the surfit gridding algorithm

<P align="justify">
<TT><B>surfit</B></TT> uses originally developed gridding method called CMOFS 
(consecutive minization of functionals sequence). The CMOFS method described below, 
allows to strictly determine the influence for each data, used for gridding. 
To process data with CMOFS algorithm it is necessary to create so-called "gridding rule". 
Gridding rule is a functional that describes how to use data in gridding.
The order of gridding rules defines the priority levels for each data. 
For example, we can think, what data given in scattered 
points are most precise and must be taken first. Information about the resulting surface 
behavior between scattered points is less reliable and we should use it at the last 
step.

To build resulting surface with CMOFS algorithm <TT><B>surfit</B></TT> determines values 
in the cells of \ref d_grid "equidistant grid":

\f[ u(x,y) = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^M u_{i,j} \phi_{i,j}(x,y), \f]

where \f$u_{i,j}\f$ are cell values, \f$\phi_{i,j}\f$ - 
set of step basis functions:

\f[
 \phi_i \left( x \right) = \left\{
  1,x \in \left[ih + a - \frac{h}
{2},(i + 1)h + a - \frac{h}
{2}\right) 
\qquad 
0, x \notin \left[ih + a - \frac{h}
{2},(i + 1)h + a - \frac{h}
{2}\right) \hfill 
\right.
\f]

Here is the breif scheme of CMOFS algorithm:
\li Classify all data to extent of truth: from less truth until indirect apriori information.
\li Write functionals sequence 
\f[
\Phi_1(u_1,\ldots,u_N),\Phi_2(u_1,\ldots,u_N),\ldots,\Phi_K(u_1,\ldots,u_N).
\f] 
These functionals describe the way of taking the data 
into account. Functionals order must corresponds to data confidence level, determined by user.
Resulting surface is founded from functionals minimization.

Then minimizing i-th functional, two situations are possible:
\par Unconstrained extremum is being searched.
The system of linear equations is being analyzed:
\f[ 
\frac {\partial \Phi_i(u_1,\ldots,u_N)} {\partial u_j} = 0, 
\f]
where \f$ j=1,\ldots,N\f$ except of numbers of cells with already solved (founded) values. 
There are two variants under consideration:
\li The SLE have only one solution.
Unknown values \f$ u_j \f$ are being determined from solution of this system of 
linear equations.
\li The SLE have many solutions, or have no solution at all.
The SLE isn't being solved. Instead of this, the conditional extremum problem
is being solved then i+1'th functional is being minimized.

\par Constrained extremum is being searched.
This situation appears if previous functional minimization was impossible, or
if additional conditions or inequalities are set. For searching of constrained extremum
the \ref penalty "penalty algorithm" is being used.
