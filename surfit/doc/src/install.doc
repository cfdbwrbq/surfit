/*! \page install Install instructions

<H2>Use installer (Windows only):</H2>
It's very simple! :) Just run surfit-2.2.exe.

<H2>Building surfit from sources:</H2>

First of all you must have installed :
\li <A HREF="http://tcl.sourceforge.net/">TCL</A> ver >= 8.3 or find ActiveTcl in the Web (for Windows)

<H3>WINDOWS:</H3>

Under Windows surfit can be built with Microsoft VC++ 6.0:
\li extract archive surfit-2.2.tar.gz
\li examine directories surfit-2.2/vc6, vc7 and vc8 

Before building make shure that you have TCL library installed!
May be you'll want to install netCDF library to build libsurfit_io with GMT import/export.
You can download it from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netcdf-3.6.1.tar.gz

<H3>UNIX:</H3>
