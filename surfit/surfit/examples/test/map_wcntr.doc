/** \example map_wcntr.tcl  

This example shows how to build surface, which approximates 3d contours. 
It was 3 contours to approximate with different levels of approximation: 
\li hi level for contour in center (<TT>surfit/examples/test/cntr_center.txt</TT>),
\li average level for small circle (<TT>surfit/examples/test/cntr_small_circle.txt</TT>)
\li low level for big circle (<TT>surfit/examples/test/cntr_big_circle.txt</TT>).

Here is image of resulting surface:

Some comments to script:
\li \ref map_name variable used to set name of resulting surface
\li \ref grid_unload function call to remove grid from result file.
