/** \example map_wiso.tcl   

This example shows how one goes from isolines to an evenly sampled smooth surface.
In this example we consider 4 isolines for \ref surfit_wiso "approximation". 
By this and \ref map_iso.tcl "isolines interpolation" examples you can 
reconstruct surfaces from set of isolines with different levels.

This result was obtained with <TT>"surfit/examples/test/map_wiso.tcl"</TT> script. 

Some comments to script:
\li \ref map_name variable used to set name of resulting surface
\li we use \ref tol variable to manage tolerance of iterative linear system solver algorithm.
If this value is too big, iterative algorithm will make low number of iterations. It leads
to rought result.
\li \ref grid_unload function call to remove grid from result file.
\li to produce more smooth surface reduce weight value in \ref wisos_read command. To produce more
precise approximation (tends to interpolation) enlarge weight value in \ref wisos_read command.
