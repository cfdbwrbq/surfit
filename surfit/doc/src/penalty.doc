/*! \page penalty penalty algorithm

One of the ways of replacing a constrained optimization problem with an unconstrained one is
by adding a penalty function to the objective function that depends - in some logical way -
on the value of the constraints.

The idea is to minimize a sequence of unconstrained minimization problems where the
infeasibility of the constraints is minimized together with the objective function.

<H2> 4.2 Penalty and Barrier Methods </H2>

One of the ways of replacing a constrained optimization problem with an unconstrained one is
by adding a penalty function to the objective function that increases depending on the value of
the constraints.

There two main types of penalization methods: penalty functions impose a penalty for violating
a constrain, and barrier methods other imposes a penalty for reaching the boundary of an
inequality constraint.

<H3> 4.2.1 The Quadratic Penalty Method </H3>
This is the simplest type of penalty function. The new objective function will be the original one
plus a term for each constraint, which is positive when the current point violates the constraint
and zero otherwise.

Consider the equality-constrained problem:

minimize \f$f(x)\f$

subject to \f$c(x) = 0\f$

where \f$c(x)\f$ is an m-dimensional vector whose j-th component is \f$c_j(x)\f$. 
We assume that all functions are twice continuously differentiable.

We require a penalty for constraint violation to be a continuous function \f$\phi\f$ with 
the following properties

\f$\phi(x) = 0\f$ if \f$x\f$ is feasible

\f$\phi(x) > 0\f$ otherwise,

The new objective function is

\f$\pi(x, \rho) = f(x) + \rho\phi(x)\f$, (4.22)

were \f$rho\f$ is positive and is called the penalty parameter.
The quadratic penalty function is defined as

\f$\pi(x, \rho) = f(x) + \frac{\rho}{2} \sum\limits_{i=1}^m h_i(x)^2 = f(x) + \frac{\rho}{2}h(x)^Th(x)\f$

<H4>Algorithm:</H4>

\li Check termination conditions. if \f$x_k\f$ satisfies the optimality conditions, he algorithm
terminates successfully.

\li Minimize the penalty function. With \f$x_k\f$ as the starting point, execute an algorithm to
solve the unconstrained subproblem

minimize \f$\pi(x, \rho_k)\f$

w.r.t. x

and let the solution of this subproblem be \f$x_{k+1}\f$.
\li Increase the penalty parameter. Set \f$\rho_{k+1}\f$ to a larger value 
than \f$\rho_k\f$, set k = k + 1 and return to 1.

<H2> About "penalty_factor" parameter </H2>

penalty_factor is a parameter that used for special gridding rules like \ref leq,
\ref geq, \ref mean, \ref wmean, \ref hist and other of this kind. These gridding
rules adds some condition and causes surfit for using penalty algorithm. Each of these gridding
rules have additional parameter called "penalty_factor". This parameter sets how fast the penalty
parameter \f$\rho\f$ should be changed.

It is recomended to set penalty_factor from -3 to 3, but for most cases the default value for
penalty_factor should be usable.
