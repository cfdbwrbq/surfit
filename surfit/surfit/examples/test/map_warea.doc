/** \example map_warea.tcl  

This example shows how to use \ref surfit::warea "warea" datatype and how to deal with unconstrained areas. 
In this example we use 5 areas: 4 with values 10, 20, 30 and 40 and one area in center 
with special value called "undefined value" (unconstrained area). Area bounds are shown 
with green rectangles. We want to make surface which approximates 4 areas with values and 
one undefined (unconstrained) in the center (area5).

Here is image of resulting surface:

Some comments to script:
\li \ref map_name variable used to set name of resulting surface
\li \ref grid_unload function call to remove grid from result file.
