use GnuWin zlib for building under Windows

for error:
1>c:\program files (x86)\gnuwin32\include\zconf.h(289): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'unistd.h': No such file or directory

change line N287 in zconf.h

#if 1           /* HAVE_UNISTD_H -- this line is updated by ./configure */

to 

#if HAVE_UNISTD_H




UBUNTU:

use Tcl8.5 instead of Tcl8.6 (bug with loading shared libraries)

Packages to build:
build-essential
tcl8.5
tcl8.5-dev
tk8.65dev (don't know why)

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
