/*! \page features surfit main features

surfit is a computer program which enables to calculate regular 
grid from various data (scattered points, curves, surfaces, etc), 
conditions and inequalities by setting called "gridding rules"

\li Requires little memory for gridding procedure with large grids and large data sets.
\li Implements very fast gridding algorithm called \ref surfit "CMOFS".
\li Extends Tcl scripting language with new commands, which enables to describe gridding procedure.

\par surfit gridding algorithm features:
\li Deals with \ref datatypes "various types of data"
\li Allows to determine priority and set specific \ref tcl_rules "gridding rule" for each data.
\li Allows to interpolate, approximate data, use inequalities and set specific conditions.
