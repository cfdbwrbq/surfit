/*! \page penalty penalty algorithm

One of the ways of replacing a constrained optimization problem with an unconstrained one is
by adding a penalty function to the objective function that depends - in some logical way -
on the value of the constraints.

The idea is to minimize a sequence of unconstrained minimization problems where the
infeasibility of the constraints is minimized together with the objective function.
