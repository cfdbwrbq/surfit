\section d_points scattered data points

"Scattered data points" are used to represent irregularly spaced XYZ data. The term "irregularly spaced" implies 
that the points are randomly distributed over the extent of the map area meaning that the 
distance between data points is not consistent over the map. When the XYZ data is randomly spaced over 
the map area, there are many "holes" in the distribution of data points. Surfit fills in the holes 
by extrapolating or interpolating Z values in those locations where no data exists by applying rules defined by user.

\section d_area area

Areas are used to represent polygonal regions. Using surfit you can set different gridding rules for these regions:
\li \ref area "interpolate" or \ref area_add "approximate" area with some value
\li \ref area_mean "mean" or \ref area_wmean "weighted" mean value for area
\li equations for area (\ref area_leq \ref area_geq \ref area_func_leq \ref area_func_geq)

\section d_curv curve

Surfit allows to set several gridding rules for curves:
\li \ref fault_add
\li \ref isoline
\li \ref isoline_add
\li equations for curves (\ref isoline_leq \ref isoline_geq)
