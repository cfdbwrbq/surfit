/*! \example fault.tcl
This example shows how one goes from randomly spaced data points to an evenly sampled 
surface with taking fault curves into account. In this sample we have 11 scattered data 
points to interpolate (file examples/surfit/curvs/11points.txt) and 4 fault curves, 
which are divide whole surface domain into 3 independent subdomains. The main idea
of fault curves is that parts of resulting surface between fault curve are independent 
of each other. \b Important! You should place \ref surfit::fault "fault" rule only after \ref surfit::fault "fault"
"fault modifiable" rules!
