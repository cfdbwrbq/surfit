\li Requires little memory for gridding procedure with large grids and large data sets.
\li Implements very fast gridding algorithm called <a href="cmofs.html">CMOFS</A>.
\li Extends Tcl scripting language with new commands, which enables to describe gridding procedure.

<LI> <a href="cmofs.html">CMOFS</A> gridding algorithm features:
	<UL TYPE=SQUARE> 
	<LI> Interpolation data: scattered data points, ordered data points, 3d contours, isolines, areas.
	<LI> Approximation data: scattered data points, ordered data points, 3d contours, isolines, areas.
	<LI> Other data: trend functions, fault lines, information about function behavior in "holes" where data are missing.

<UL>
<LI> Import/Export:
\li Import/Export of Surfer GRD-ASCII files.
\li Import/Export of points and curves from columned text files.
</UL>

\li Huge grid can be displayed with help of wavelet analysis. 
\li Quality of resulting surface is comparable with a surface created by Kriging or Minimum curvature method.
