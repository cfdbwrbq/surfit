/** \example map_trend.tcl 

This example shows how one goes from randomly spaced data points to an evenly sampled surface
with taking trend surface (from binary ROFF file <TT>surfit/examples/ftest/func.func</TT>) and 
one fault line into account. In this sample we have 7 scattered 
data points to interpolate (file <TT>surfit/examples/test/7points.txt</TT>) and 1 fault line
(file <TT>surfit/examples/test/1fault.txt</TT>). The main idea of taking trend surface into 
account is that the resulting surface should repeat trend surface in the areas out of scattered
data points. The domain consistency of resulting surface should be broken trough the fault line.

On the picture you can see the result of CMOFS gridding algorithm. 
Interpolation data points showed with green dots, fault line with white line. 
Trend surface is under result surface.

This is how it is done (file <TT>"surfit/examples/test/map_trend.tcl"</TT>) and some comments to script:
\li \ref map_name variable used to set name of resulting surface
\li we use \ref tol variable to manage tolerance of iterative linear system solver algorithm.
If this value is too big, iterative algorithm will make low number of iterations. It leads
to rought result.
\li \ref grid_unload function call to remove grid from result file.
