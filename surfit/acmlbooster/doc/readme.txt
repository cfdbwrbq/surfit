Hi!
This library is a loadable module for surfit.
This library implements the "Conjugate Gradients" method
using ACML (http://developer.amd.com/acml.aspx) functions. 
To use this library you should load it with a Tcl command:

# load libacmlbooster[info sharedlibextension]

Then library is loaded, you can set solver variable to "cg_acml"
with a command:

# set_solver "cg_acml"
