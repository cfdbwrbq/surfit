/** \example map_flt.tcl    

This example shows how one goes from randomly spaced data points to an evenly sampled surface
with taking fault lines into account. In this sample we have 11 scattered data points to interpolate
(file <TT>surfit/examples/test/11points.txt</TT>) and 4 fault lines, which divide surface domain into 4 subdomains. 
The main idea of taking fault lines into account is that these lines should split total surface domain
into 4 independent subdomains: each subdomain must have no influence to other subdomains. In practical use
fault lines may not divide into subdomains. Then domain consistency will be broken trough the fault lines.

This is how it is done (file <TT>"surfit/examples/test/map_flt.tcl"</TT>) and some comments to script:
\li \ref map_name variable used to set name of resulting surface
\li we use \ref tol variable to manage tolerance of iterative linear system solver algorithm.
If this value is too big, iterative algorithm will make low number of iterations. It leads
to rought result.
\li \ref grid_unload function call to remove grid from result file.
