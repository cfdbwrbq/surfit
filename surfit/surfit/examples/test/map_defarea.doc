/** \example map_defarea.tcl

This example show how to set domain of definition for surface. In this
example we use example function from binary ROFF file "func.func". We use
command \ref func_to_defarea to make domain of the function. After that 
we load function from file "func.func" again and recalculate it with respect
of constructed domain of definition. Result on the picture below:
