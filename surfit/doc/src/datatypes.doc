\section d_points scattered data points

"Scattered data points" are used to represent irregularly spaced XYZ data. The term "irregularly spaced" implies 
that the points are randomly distributed over the extent of the map area meaning that the 
distance between data points is not consistent over the map. When the XYZ data is randomly spaced over 
the map area, there are many "holes" in the distribution of data points. Surfit fills in the holes 
by extrapolating or interpolating Z values in those locations where no data exists by applying rules defined by user.

\section d_surf surface

A digital representation of a continuous variable over a two-dimensional surface by a regular 
array of z values. Surfaces are typically used to represent terrain relief, soil maps, pressure fields and other.
