/*! \example contour.tcl

This example shows how to build \ref d_surf "surface" using \ref d_cntr "contours". In this example
3 different contours were used. Two of them were (cntr_big_circle, cntr_center) approximated by resulting surface. 
Another one (cntr_big_circle) was used to modify \ref completer() "completer" gridding rule with weight.

\sa \ref contour() "contour", \ref contour_add() "contour_add", \ref completer() "completer"

\htmlonly
Here is the image of the resulting surface:

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG alt="surface built from areas" src="contour.jpg" border="0">
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER> Pic 1. Surface built from contours </P>

\endhtmlonly

This result was obtained with <TT>"examples/surfit/curvs/contour.tcl"</TT> script.

/*! \example contour_ineq.tcl

This example looks like \ref contour.tcl "contour.tcl" example, but it contains 2 set of contours: "lower "
set and "upper" set. Upper set of contours is shifted up at 0.2. The resulting surface is between
these contours sets.

\sa \ref contour_leq() "contour_leq", \ref contour_geq() "contour_geq", \ref completer() "completer"

\htmlonly
Here is the image of the resulting surface:

<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG alt="surface built from areas" src="contour_ineq.jpg" border="0">
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER> Pic 1. Surface built from contour inequalities </P>

\endhtmlonly

This result was obtained with <TT>"examples/surfit/curvs/contour_ineq.tcl"</TT> script.
